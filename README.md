## ðŸ”¶ Tasks Overview

The project contains several tasks organized in folders `01` to `05`, each demonstrating different styling methods. Below is an overview of the tasks:

- **01** â€“ Create an `<Alert>` component styled with **Styled Components**. The component should support variants like `primary` and `secondary`.
- **02** â€“ Build a `<Button>` component similar to **React Bootstrap**, supporting props like `variant`, `size`, `active`, and `disabled`.
- **03** â€“ Implement a `<Breadcrumb>` component with `<Breadcrumb.Item>` for navigation. It should support `href` and `active` props.
- **04** â€“ Develop `<Tabs>` and `<Tab>` components to manage tabbed content. The active tab should dynamically update the displayed content.
- **05** â€“ Create a `<Card>` component composed of subcomponents like `<Card.Img>`, `<Card.Body>`, `<Card.Title>`, and `<Card.Text>`. Use the previously created `<Button>` component within the card.

Each task includes specific instructions in its respective `README.md` file.

&nbsp;

## ðŸ”¶ Solutions provided in the project

### One of examples:
The `<Card>` component is a complex and reusable component built with subcomponents like `<Card.Img>`, `<Card.Body>`, `<Card.Title>`, and `<Card.Text>`. It demonstrates advanced component composition and integration with the previously created `<Button>` component.

```jsx
<Card>
  <Card.Img src="image.jpg" alt="Example" />
  <Card.Body>
    <Card.Title>Card Title</Card.Title>
    <Card.Text>Some example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</Card.Text>
    <Button variant="primary">Go somewhere</Button>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

This example showcases:
- **Dynamic styling**: Styled Components are used to style the card and its subcomponents.
- **Component composition**: The `<Card>` component is composed of smaller, reusable subcomponents.
- **Integration**: The `<Button>` component created in Task 02 is reused within the `<Card>` component.

For more details, refer to the implementation in [Task05.js](05/Task05.js) and the corresponding [README.md](05/README.md).

&nbsp;

## ðŸ”¶ Conclusions

- **Dynamic styling**: Styled Components were used extensively to enable dynamic and reusable styling across components.
- **Component composition**: Components like `<Card>` and `<Tabs>` were designed with subcomponents for better modularity and reusability.
- **Scalability**: The project demonstrates how to organize styles and components for scalable React applications.
- **Theming**: The use of `ThemeProvider` allows for centralized theme management, making it easier to maintain consistent styling.

This project provides a solid foundation for mastering React component styling techniques.
